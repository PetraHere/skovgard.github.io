                    But the real question is why.<br>What does make Mona Lisa stands out beside
                    all other great paintings?<br>This might surprise you, but Mona Lisa
                    painting would never become so worldwide

                    Love him or hate him, director Wes Anderson is one of the few contemporary filmmakers who have an easily recognizable style of filmmaking.<br><br>In fact, you can't see Futura font or a carefully arranged symmetrical overhead shot without immediately thinking of films like The Royal Tenenbaums, Grand Hotel Budapest, or Moonrise Kingdom.<br>But why?
                    <p>
                        It turns out Wes Anderson employs symmetry in many of his shots. Draw up an imaginary line along the center of a Wes Anderson frame and it is very likely to divide something in halfâ€”a face, panoramic view, a vintage curio.<br><br>But there are much more Trademarks which can tell you you ar watching Wes Anderson's movie.

                <h2>The Story of Rembrant's<br>most mysterious painting<br>The Night Watch</h2>

                <p>
                    Night Watch is renowned for 3 characteristics: its colossal size,the effective use of light and shadow, and the perception of motion in what would have traditionally been a static military portrait.<br>But that's not all.
                    <p>
                        After The Night Watch was finished, Rembrandt had to appear for court summons. Apparently there was a lot to explain.
