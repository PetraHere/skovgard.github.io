                <p id="first"> Even today, a century after they were produced, Egon Schiele's drawings have the power to shock numerous people.
                    His work is noted for its intensity and its raw sexuality.
                    But was it only a libidinous obsessions of a wild youth or is it true that Schiele had some serious trouble with controlling his passions?
                </p>
                <img id="schiele1" src="images/schiele1.jpg" />
                <p>
                    The 100th anniversary of Egon Schiele’s death has arrived just in time for the
                    #MeToo movement. Which makes it a perfect opportunity to talk about Schiele’s post
                    in pantheon of historical well debuted artist-abusers.
                    Is this position on the list deserved?

                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s be honest first, Schiele was an art genius.
                    There is a total confidence in his line, a commitment to the figure and a boldness in his imposition of figure on space, that sets him apart from almost any other artist of his time.
                    The more it is the breathtaking fact that he has finished around 2,500 pieces.
                    Although he died young at age of 28.
                </p>
                <img id="schiele2" src="images/schiele2.jpg" />
                <p>
                    Yes and over a half of those works on paper were devoted to the subject of women depicted nude or semi-nude.
                    There is no question that his drawings and watercolours are provocative. Nude Girls Reclining (1911), depicts two very young girls lying side by side. Schiele draws their bodies with a steady hand, capturing the curve of one's breast in close juxtaposition with her companion's tuft of pubic hair between neatly defined legs.
                    Pornographic? Inappropriate?

                    <p>
                        Love him or hate him, director Wes Anderson is one of the few contemporary filmmakers who have an easily recognizable style of filmmaking.<br><br>In fact, you can't see Futura font or a carefully arranged symmetrical overhead shot without immediately thinking of films like The Royal Tenenbaums, Grand Hotel Budapest, or Moonrise Kingdom.<br>But why?
                        <p>
                            It turns out Wes Anderson employs symmetry in many of his shots. Draw up an imaginary line along the center of a Wes Anderson frame and it is very likely to divide something in half—a face, panoramic view, a vintage curio.<br><br>But there are much more Trademarks which can tell you you ar watching Wes Anderson's movie.

                        <p id="first"> Although you may not know the name Katsushika Hokusai, it’s almost guaranteed that you’ve seen at least one of his works: <br> Under the Wave off Kanagawa (ca. 1830–32), more commonly known as The Great Wave.
                        </p>

                        <h3>1. Hokusai was known by at least 30 names
                            during his lifetime.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Although it was a common practice for Japanese artists to use multiple names, his use far exceeded other major Japanese artists of the time. <br><br>
                            His name changes were so frequent and so often related to changes in his artistic style, that they are used to divide his life into periods.
                        </p>
                        <h3> 2. Hokusai commenced his most important
                            work at age 70.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Although Hokusai was prosperous in middle age, his series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji in 1830 eventually brought him international acclaim.
